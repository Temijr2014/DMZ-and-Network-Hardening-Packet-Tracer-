# DMZ and Network Hardening (Packet Tracer)🌐

## Objective✔️

The objective of this project is to design and implement a secure DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) network architecture using Cisco Packet Tracer, while applying industry-standard network hardening techniques. This project demonstrates how to properly segment internal, external, and DMZ networks, enforce access control through ACLs, secure Layer 2 switches, configure NAT on a firewall, and implement basic services such as HTTP, FTP, Email, and SSH.

### Skills Learned 💯

- Understand how DMZ networks protect internal systems from external threats.

- Configure secure VLAN segmentation for proper isolation of network zones.

- Apply ACLs to control and restrict traffic between the Internet, DMZ, and LAN.

- Implement NAT on a firewall to securely expose services to external clients.

- Harden switches and routers with port security, SSH, and login protection.

- Build a realistic SOC-oriented environment suitable for monitoring and analysis.

### Tools Used⚒️

- Packet Tracer.
